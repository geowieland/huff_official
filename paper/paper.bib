abstract = {Predicting airport catchment areas is essential for airport site selection and operational revenue evaluation; however, it encounters a technical challenge due to the limited accuracy of existing prediction models. This study employs mobile location data collected from Baidu to estimate the catchment areas of major airports in China's Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region and investigates the optimal exponent for predicting these areas using the Huff model. The findings indicate that, firstly, the catchment areas of YRD airports comprise regions accessible within a three-hour commute, with flight frequency and accessibility serving as the primary determinants. Secondly, the average distance decay exponent of the calibrated Huff model is 3.8, and empirical validation demonstrates the model's high effectiveness for distance decay exponents ranging from 3.0 to 6.5. Thirdly, the Huff model, calibrated with the optimal distance decay exponent, attains an accuracy of 83.06%, representing an improvement of approximately 19.24% to 22.58% compared to the traditional Huff model. Although the Huff model exhibits strong applicability for predicting airport catchment areas, it remains limited by the linear assumptions inherent in its structure. Future research should explore the influence of nonlinear models on the Huff model.}

ABSTRACT = {Park green space (PGS) is an important part of urban ecosystem and green infrastructure, and the ease of access to PGS is closely related to the health of residents. A growing number of studies have attempted to identify accessibility disparities, but results have varied because of the travel mode choice and the measurement method. This study proposes a dynamic Huff two-step floating catchment area (H2SFCA) method based on map service API (Application Programming Interface) to assess the accessibility of PGS, with the Gini coefficient and bivariate local Moran’s I used to analyze accessibility equity. Results show that: (1) driving and biking modes have more significant spatiotemporal compression effects than dynamic modes, public transit, and walking mode. (2) The accessibility values and spatial patterns vary significantly by travel mode. The PGS availability pattern at the local level is more uneven than the distribution of accessibility at the regional level. In comparison with dynamic travel modes, the accessibility values for the single travel mode are more likely to be overestimated or underestimated. (3) The PGS accessibility by the dynamic modes generally has better spatial equity and residents can select suitable travel tools to acquire more equitable park services. In addition, there is a significant accessibility difference between dynamic driving-based mode and dynamic transit-based mode in four subdistricts, which are mainly located in the south of Tianhe District. The public transport facilities linking parks in these areas need to be optimized. This study further improves the accessibility evaluation method, with the findings conducive to the implementation of refined PGS planning and management.},
